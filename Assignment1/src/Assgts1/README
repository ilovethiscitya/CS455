List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

The input of NumberofTrails can't be the negative values.
Sometimes the sum of three probability is not 100(already use Math.round)

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?
For a random simulation, the probability of two heads, one head and one tail and two tails are 36%, 31% and 33%. Because it is random.
2. Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.
I have done many experiments. It seems that the results are within 1% when the number of trails exceeds 10000.
3. Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually works for very large values that are within the limits. Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results (probably slower on aludra than on you own machine).
When the number of trails exceeds 2147483647(Integer.MAX_VALUE), it will crash with an overflow error. The biggest number I have tried is 2147483647, but it overflows when I tried 2147483647(Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1).
